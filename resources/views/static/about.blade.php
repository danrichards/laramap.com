                                Laramap is a platform for laravel-developers around the world.
                                On Laramap you can connect to other laravel developers in your area, create local user-groups and write articles. But you can also follow up whats going on in the community.

                                Back in 2015, <a href="https://twitter.com/fwartner">Florian Wartner</a> was building up Laramap.com as his first project made with Laravel 4.2 .. He was looking for a community, that shows him developers in his area to connect, learn and collaborate. The project was much welcome by the community.
                                Within a few weeks there were over 3000 developers around the world signed up to the website.

                            <p>
                                After a shutdown due to some personal issues, he went back to his computer and re-wrote everything to itÂ´s current state.
